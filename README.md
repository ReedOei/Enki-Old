This repo contains the proposed syntax/semantics for Enki, a beginner-focused logic language.

There is an initial vim syntax highlighting file (`enki.vim`).
To use it, copy it to `~/.vim/syntax` and then add the following line to your `.vimrc`:

```
au BufRead,BufNewFile *.enki set filetype=enki
```
